        <h2> More about me </h2>
        <p> As someone passionate about traveling and exploring new cultures, I've had the opportunity to delve into various spiritual traditions. Along with completing a 300-hour yoga teacher training in Nepal, I've attended two 10-day silent Vipassana meditation courses. These practices have helped me develop inner peace, clarity, empathy, and mindfulness, which have positively impacted my personal and professional life. I believe that spiritual growth is a vital aspect of my journey, and it plays a significant role in personal and professional development. </p>

        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>
           Professionally, I have 12+ years of experience in sales, business development, relationship management, and customer service in leading multinational companies. Now, transitioning to digital marketing, I'm seeking internship opportunities to gain hands-on experience and knowledge in this field. My education in business administration, marketing, and communications complements my skills. I am fully committed to learning and growing in this field and believe that an internship will provide me with the hands-on experience and knowledge needed to excel in a career in digital marketing.
